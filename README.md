# FlickViewer
Some test project for viewing Flick Photos

I used MVVM for this project with simple delegate notifiying of ViewModel.
Of course it was better to user some reactive approach wich is in tasks list.

Todo:

1. Adding UT
2. Impelementing obsering of UT throgh Reactive observation
3. Error Handling
4. Image opening
5. Etc
